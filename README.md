# CHIMERA AI Trading Dashboard - Website Deployment

## 📁 Files for Your Website

### **Main Website Files**
- `index.html` - Main website page with integrated CHIMERA dashboard
- `.htaccess` - Apache URL rewriting for API endpoints

### **API Files**
- `api/chimera/index.php` - PHP API endpoint to receive/serve CHIMERA data

### **Local Testing**
- `test_api.py` - Test script to verify API functionality

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### **Step 1: Upload Files to Your Website**

Upload these files to your `tradingtoday.com.au` root directory:

```
tradingtoday.com.au/
├── index.html
├── .htaccess
└── api/
    └── chimera/
        └── index.php
```

### **Step 2: Set File Permissions**

Make sure the API directory is writable:
```bash
chmod 755 api/chimera/
chmod 644 api/chimera/index.php
```

### **Step 3: Test the API**

Visit these URLs to test:
- `https://tradingtoday.com.au/api/chimera/health` - Should return API status
- `https://tradingtoday.com.au/` - Your main website with dashboard

### **Step 4: Update CHIMERA System**

The CHIMERA system is already configured to send data to:
`https://tradingtoday.com.au/api/chimera/update`

## 🔧 API Endpoints
